Your project idea
The spellbook. This spellbook allows users to sort through DnD spells (from the DnD API) by class and level. then they can choose their spells and add them to their spellbook. when they open the book users can see what the spell requires ( components, time, whether it's concentration or not) and all other information. users can then decide to discard the spell from their book.
